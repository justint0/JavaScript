What is OOP?

  - OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects. Objects model real-world or abstract features and may contain data (properties) and code (methods).

  - Objects are the building blocks of applications and interact with one another through a public interface (API).

  - In JavaScript, objects are linked to a prototype object and can access its methods. This is prototypal inheritance.

The 4 Fundamental OOP Principles

  - Abstraction: Hiding details that don't matter from the end user. 
  - Encapsulation: Control access to data and functions. 
  - Inheritance: Child classes retain data and functions from parent classes. 
  - Polymorphism: Child classes can overwrite methods inherited from parent classes.

3 Ways of Implementing Prototypal Inheritance in JavaScript

  - Constructor function is a function that acts as a blueprint for creating objects.
  - ES6 classes is a modern alternative to constructor functions
  - Object.create() creates a new object, using an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object.
