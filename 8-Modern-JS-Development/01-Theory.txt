An Overview of Modern JavaScript Development

  - Development: applications consist of modules and 3rd party packages from npm

  - Build process: Bundling joins all modules into one file and transpiling/polyfilling converts modern JavaScript back to ES5

  - Production: JavaScript bundle

An Overview of Modules in JavaScript

  - A module is a function or group of similar functions. They are grouped together within a file and contain the code to execute a specific task when called into a larger application. You create modules to better organize and structure your codebase.

  - An ES6 module is a JavaScript file that executes in strict mode only. It means that any variables or functions declared in the module won't be added automatically to the global scope. 
  
  - ES6 modules can use import and export. 

  - Add type='module' to a script tag.

Top-level Await

  - You can use await at the top-level of a module. Your module won't finish loading until the promise you await settles.
