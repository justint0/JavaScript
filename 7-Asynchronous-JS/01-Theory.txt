Asynchronous JavaScript, AJAX, and APIs
  - Synchronous: Code is executed line by line (blocking).
  - Asynchronous: Executed in the background (non-blocking).

  - With AJAX calls, we can request data from web servers dynamically.

  - APIs allow applications to talk to each other. We can build an API or use a third-party API.

How the Web Works: Requests and Responses
  1.) DNS Lookup
  2.) TCP/IP socket connection is established between browser and server
  3.) Client makes an HTTP request with start line (HTTP method, request target, HTTP version), request headers, and request body (only when sending data to server).
  4.) Server sends an HTTP response with start line (HTTP version, status code, status message), response headers, and response body (JSON data or HTML).
