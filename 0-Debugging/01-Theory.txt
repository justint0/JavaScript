Software bug: Defect or problem in a computer program. Any unexpected or unintended behavior of a computer program is a software bug.

Debugging: Process of finding, fixing, and preventing bugs.

The Debugging Process
  - Identify (becoming aware that there is a bug)
    - During development
    - Testing software
    - User reports during production
  
  - Find (isolating where exactly the bug is happening in code)
    - Use the developer console or the debugger
  
  - Fix (correct the bug)
    - Replace the wrong solution with a correct solution
  
  - Prevent
    - Search for the bug elsewhere
    - Write tests to detect bugs
