JavaScript has 7 primitive data types.

- Numbers (JS does not define different types of numbers)
  - Example: 10, 4.0

- Strings
  - Example: 'Justin', "Hello World"

- Booleans
  - Example: true, false

- Undefined means a variable is not defined
  - Example: let a >>> console.log(a) // This will return undefined.

- Null means no value
  - typeof null >>> object

- Symbols are immutable (cannot be changed) and are unique.

- BigInt values represent numeric values which are too large to be represented by the number primitive.


- JavaScript has dynamic typing - variables can be reassigned to different data types.
- The typeof operator shows us the data type of a variable.
  - Example: console.log(typeof 23)
